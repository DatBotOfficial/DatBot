Hello y'all!

I am Gamet, the founder of Dat Bot and developer. I started this project back in April of 2022 as a fun way to learn programming and growing a community. Nowadays, it has grown and is bigger than I thought it could ever get. Thank you for using Dat Bot! :tada:

Hey everyone!

I'm byPixelTV, one of the staff members of Dat Bot. I started using the bot in April 2023 and have always been helping users more or less on the support server. I still help people on the support server, but I also like to develop Minecraft plugins in my free time. Maybe we'll see each other on the support server, but for now I just want to say: Thanks for using Dat Bot! ðŸŽ‰

Bye ðŸ‘‹
